## Computer Requirements
1. **USB-A** cables are recommended to use, USB-C to may have issues with palera1n and getting into DFU mode.
> Due to USB-C cables having different accessory IDs, your device may not be able to be recognized when using USB-C due to not being able to assert to its USB voltage pin.

2. **Linux or macOS computer**
> AMD CPUs (not AMD Mobile) have an issue where it causes them to have a very low success rate with checkm8 exploit. It is not recommended that you use them with palera1n.

> USB-C port on Apple Silicon Macs *may* require manual unplugging and replugging of the lightning cable after checkm8 exploit. This problem may be solved by connecting via USB hub, though extensions can vary.
